Software Engineering Fall 2017 Final Project

The purpose of this project is to develop and refine the skills of implementing a Software Engineering project. Our project consists of Markov Chain natural language processing, where we the training data for the process will consist of personal user information, coming from places such as Facebook posts, Facebook Messenger messages, or play/movie scripts.  
Our goals for this project include creating a release deliverable that users can interact with, and easily obtain their desired output. In our case, output would be sentences that are developed from the training data. We also want to better understand the stochastic process behind the Markov Process, to better apply it on our models and project.
