Early Muslim history was a turbulent era on the methods of succession of power. The first leader of Islam was the Prophet Muhammad, who had that claim by being the last prophet sent by God, and the person who united the Arabs into becoming a community under one religion. A theme that came to govern the times that followed the Prophet’s death was that of the struggle for dominance. Various interpretations came about on how the possession of power should be handled, and this led to an onset of many civil wars and infighting between the elite Arab tribes. Since the caliphate was a relatively new community, much of its laws were still in development. Because of this, the legal tradition regarding whether a caliph should be chosen via appointment or election was a contested point. The very first caliphs were selected by a group of scholars, but later on dynasties and rules of succession were introduces. Due to the Muslim legal tradition being an ever-changing vehicle during the early periods of the Islamic Caliphate, the knowledge that was being transmitted was easily challenged: seen by the ongoing dispute of the Umayyad Dynasty, where their own interpretation allowed them to become khalifat Allah, or God’s caliph, and also alter the method of transfer of power to establish their lineage as the one that should always be in power.
