#indoorskydivingWow! Hats off to निमेष बराल and his team. Ekchoti chahi hernai par6!These couple of days has been very exciting for me. Firstly, I gave my first ever speech in School Assembly of BNKS(where I studied form grade 4 to grade 10) addressing the school. It was not nerve-wrecking as I thought it would be. It went smooth. Although I felt that most of the teachers did not know what I was talking about, most A-level students understood at least some bit of it (those were my intended audience). 
Secondly, I had lunch in BNKS after three years. NO, that was not a good move. Sunday’s lunch is still the same. I so much regretted declining Dikendra dai’s offer to have lunch in his home. 
Finally and most importantly, we launched our first ever website. To describe it in a single sentence it is a one stop answer hub to get all your burning college questions answered. Visit www.collegesodhpuch.com or follow our Fb page: College सोधपुछ for updates.Happy New Year Everyone. NO YOU DID NOT READ IT WRONG.

Thank you Bhushan for this awesome article. It brings those wonderful memories back. Still, whenever anyone mentions about Yarsagumba the first person that comes to my mind is Sagyan. And I am sure that is going to stick to my mind for....like forever.
It's very true that no one in BNKS is overweight. The school food does all the trick. :)  No need for workout or controlled diet. 

Looking forward to meeting you guys this summer. Now IB is over, time to get rid of that hair :pBowling!!!Woke up early in the morning to do my Maths Portfolio. But, the cricket match was so interesting that I could not concentrate on my maths. Come on Paras we need some fours and sixes.  Come on Nepalese Cricketers don't make me regret for not doing my Maths Portfolio.Although it was university fair and we were supposed to be looking for universities...we were busy taking photos!!!A thank you note to विजय सामुदायिक शिक्षा सदन (I tried to post it in your timeline but I could not because of internet security configurations)

Finally, time has come for me to say goodbye to you all wonderful people. The month I worked with you was probably one of the best thing that I did in my life. You guys were brilliant and always helpful and forthcoming. Although, it was something that you had never heard of before, you guys picked it fast and did very well. We are all very proud of you. If it had not been you guys we would not have been able to conduct two MUN programmes inviting five other colleges of the area in a short period of time. I hope these sessions have really helped you to develop your public speaking and diplomatic skills and enrich your knowledge about the world issues. 
The time I spent with you proved to be very fruitful to me as well. While helping you to improve your public speaking and chairing the committees I improved mine a lot. Working with the school administration and sometime negotiating with them I believe my diplomacy has gone up.  Moreover, this was the first time in my life that I got to learn so much about my own village which had seemed far away and distant in these recent years. This one month with you made me realise how little I knew about Gaindakot and how great it is. Thank you so much for helping me to experience the true Gaindakot and being wonderful friends. 
I would also like to thank Vijay FM for covering our progamme, VDRC for their technical support, Bhumiraj sir and Gopinath sir for attending our programme instead their busy schedule, providing us with wonderful ideas and motivating us (VSSS students are lucky to have people like you), LIMUN  for their technical support  and all the other colleges involved for their participation and encouragement. Thank you all- security dais, all the teachers involved, technicians dais and everyone who had helped directly and indirectly for making this programme a success. 
I would also like to express my sincere thanks and heartfelt gratitude to Deepak Wagle sir for believing in me and my idea about MUN and being able to see the importance of programmes like MUN for students of Gaindakot. He was always there helping and supporting me throughout my stay. For me, he was not only the principal of VSSS but also a friend and a mentor who was always there to help me and watch my back to make sure that everything was going the way it should go. Sir, you are a visionary man and you always have good intentions towards your school. I feel privileged to have got chance to work with you.  I believe VSSS family is proud to have you as the Principal and I am sure with your dedication, hard work and bright ideas school will reach a greater height. I hope you continue to inspire young people like us and provide wonderful opportunities to improve our skills. I am sure that you will keep your promise of extending MUN to student of other areas as well. 

Thank you everyone for making my stay a wonderful one and I look forward to working with you next year as well.Yesterday, I spent my whole day working in my neighbour’s farm helping him harvest his maize. My father was supposed to help him but I wanted to give my father a break. So, I replaced my father in the field. It was already more than a year that I had laid my hand in any agricultural work. Although it was very tiring it was interesting to get back in the field and listen to the farmers discuss politics and their household problems. It was fascinating to know that none of the farmers had changed. They still curse the politicians for making their life a living hell (as they say) and they do not get tired. 

By the end of the day I was totally exhausted and did not have any energy to do anything. My whole body was in pain and still is. However, I really enjoyed it.  I think it was worth all those thousands of joules of energy I invested.Yesterday, I got chance to visit Chaudhary Group production site situated in Nawalparasi, the first industry of Nepali origin that has investment outlay of over $1Billion. The business that started with fabric trade; now includes over 40 businesses, spanning across all five continents and has a recognizable impact on South Asia. There is not a single business sector in Nepal where CG has not laid its hand into. 
The famous Wai Wai Noodles which is available in almost all parts of the world is also a product of CG. The rising popularity of Wai Wai in India and other countries led CG Foods to open 3 factories of Wai Wai in India making it the first multinational company of Nepali origin.  I was also lucky enough to see how the how the most sought after brand of Nepal Wai wai noodles is produced. 
With big industries shutting down because of load shedding and political reasons in Nepal CG stands as important and strong business which is still growing and becoming a major part of Asian Economy. It's good to know that our country also has an industry that has made an impact in international market. We need more industries like CG and more industrialists like Binod Chaudhary to improve and strengthen our economy and get international market for Nepalese product. 

A very big thank you to Deepak Wagle sir for making this visit possible.Flying up in the air!!!Before I started the race I had thought ha..it's just thirteen miles. After I started running then I thought oh...it's thirteeeeen miles. When I completed the race I again thought ha...it was just thirteen miles. But now I am in bed with a sore leg thinking wow...that was thirteen miles.  Hastings half marathon, I survived it. 
Thank you all my sponsers and supporters. Although my timing was not great, I enjoyed every bit of it. It was worth every joule of energy that I invested.IB first year Nepali boys....Moge dai Lai IB ko virus le choyo!Back in my country people are staying late at night drinking and playing cards to mark our great festival Dashain, but here I am staying late night writing essays and studying for tests.Bowling!!!Mission Dolpa - a grand successIt's very humbling to be selected as one of the 100 FACES OF IMPACT of the world.

I would also like to express my sincere thanks and heartfelt gratitude to Deepak Wagle sir for believing in me and my idea about MUN and being able to see the importance of programmes like MUN for students of Gaindakot. He was always there helping and supporting me throughout my stay. For me, he was not only the principal of VSSS but also a friend and a mentor who was always there to help me and watch my back to make sure that everything was going the way it should go. Sir, you are a visionary man and you always have good intentions towards your school. I feel privileged to have got chance to work with you.  I believe VSSS family is proud to have you as the Principal and I am sure with your dedication, hard work and bright ideas school will reach a greater height. I hope you continue to inspire young people like us and provide wonderful opportunities to improve our skills. I am sure that you will keep your promise of extending MUN to student of other areas as well. 

Thank you everyone for making my stay a wonderful one and I look forward to working with you next year as well.Yesterday, I spent my whole day working in my neighbour’s farm helping him harvest his maize. My father was supposed to help him but I wanted to give my father a break. So, I replaced my father in the field. It was already more than a year that I had laid my hand in any agricultural work. Although it was very tiring it was interesting to get back in the field and listen to the farmers discuss politics and their household problems. It was fascinating to know that none of the farmers had changed. They still curse the politicians for making their life a living hell (as they say) and they do not get tired. 

By the end of the day I was totally exhausted and did not have any energy to do anything. My whole body was in pain and still is. However, I really enjoyed it.  I think it was worth all those thousands of joules of energy I invested.Yesterday, I got chance to visit Chaudhary Group production site situated in Nawalparasi, the first industry of Nepali origin that has investment outlay of over $1Billion. The business that started with fabric trade; now includes over 40 businesses, spanning across all five continents and has a recognizable impact on South Asia. There is not a single business sector in Nepal where CG has not laid its hand into. 
The famous Wai Wai Noodles which is available in almost all parts of the world is also a product of CG. The rising popularity of Wai Wai in India and other countries led CG Foods to open 3 factories of Wai Wai in India making it the first multinational company of Nepali origin.  I was also lucky enough to see how the how the most sought after brand of Nepal Wai wai noodles is produced. 
With big industries shutting down because of load shedding and political reasons in Nepal CG stands as important and strong business which is still growing and becoming a major part of Asian Economy. It's good to know that our country also has an industry that has made an impact in international market. We need more industries like CG and more industrialists like Binod Chaudhary to improve and strengthen our economy and get international market for Nepalese product.

Tedx link: http://www.tedxnyuad.org/speakers#1Have you wondered why politicians aren't what they used to be, why governments seem unable to solve real problems?  It's because you can be in politics today but not be in power — because real power now belongs to those who control the economy.

I will primarily be talking about a website called College Sodhpuch in which, I and some of my friends have been working on since August. Sodhpuch. College Sodhpuch is an online forum, where anyone can ask questions about colleges in Nepal or elsewhere in the world and anyone can answer; thereby helping each other. Unlike many other online forums we also have a valid Answer Team consisting of Nepali students studying in various parts of the world who answers the questions. 
College SodhPuch is not a consultancy and we do not make money out of it. We are just a bunch of Nepalese students, who think our experiences can be helpful for the other Nepalese willing to apply to colleges in different parts of the world including in Nepal.  Our aim is to depart information about educational opportunities free of cost to everyone. Visit the site to know how we do it and why we do it. (www.collegesodhpuch.com) 
You can help us by visiting the site, asking questions or writing answers. Also Like us on Facebook and share it among your friends. Thank you.""This weekend taught me that the world does not care about the people of Lebanon as much as it does about those of Paris. We are an afterthought. Why sugarcoat it? A Western life is worth more than an Arab one.""I was reading a novel for my literature core class and it turns out that the novel is the English Translation of the Nepali novel Basain (बसाईं).

#fallbreak2015inIstanbulYes, you are right. I am flying :D 
#indoorskydivingWow! Hats off to निमेष बराल and his team. Ekchoti chahi hernai par6!These couple of days has been very exciting for me. Firstly, I gave my first ever speech in School Assembly of BNKS(where I studied form grade 4 to grade 10) addressing the school. It was not nerve-wrecking as I thought it would be. It went smooth. Although I felt that most of the teachers did not know what I was talking about, most A-level students understood at least some bit of it (those were my intended audience). 
Secondly, I had lunch in BNKS after three years. NO, that was not a good move. Sunday’s lunch is still the same. I so much regretted declining Dikendra dai’s offer to have lunch in his home. 
Finally and most importantly, we launched our first ever website. To describe it in a single sentence it is a one stop answer hub to get all your burning college questions answered. Visit www.collegesodhpuch.com or follow our Fb page: College सोधपुछ for updates.Happy New Year Everyone. NO YOU DID NOT READ IT WRONG. It is Nepali New Year 2072 today. :)After over 4 hours of flight and over 8 hours of bus ride, finally arrived to the final destination! :DBubble football (soccer) in NYUAD! I did not know such a sport existed....until yesterday. I am glad I tried it. It was so much fun. We all should try it. (At least once).WWE In Abu Dhabi!!Its freezing cold here in Kathmandu. I already miss the warmth of Abu Dhabi.Last horse riding session of the semester!Pakistan New Zealand Series 2014 Game 1.
Watching a match in a stadium takes the excitement to a whole new level. The crowd, their shouting and chanting. A evening could not be better than this.This is how it looks from the tallest building of the world! Makes all the other skyscrapers look so miniatureEveryone who has been to BNKS(especially 4000D) should read this. 
Thank you Bhushan for this awesome article. It brings those wonderful memories back. Still, whenever anyone mentions about Yarsagumba the first person that comes to my mind is Sagyan. And I am sure that is going to stick to my mind for....like forever.
It's very true that no one in BNKS is overweight. The school food does all the trick. :)  No need for workout or controlled diet. 

Looking forward to meeting you guys this summer. Now IB is over, time to get rid of that hair :pBowling!!!Woke up early in the morning to do my Maths Portfolio. But, the cricket match was so interesting that I could not concentrate on my maths. Come on Paras we need some fours and sixes.  Come on Nepalese Cricketers don't make me regret for not doing my Maths Portfolio.Although it was university fair and we were supposed to be looking for universities...we were busy taking photos!!!A thank you note to विजय सामुदायिक शिक्षा सदन (I tried to post it in your timeline but I could not because of internet security configurations)

Finally, time has come for me to say goodbye to you all wonderful people. The month I worked with you was probably one of the best thing that I did in my life. You guys were brilliant and always helpful and forthcoming. Although, it was something that you had never heard of before, you guys picked it fast and did very well. We are all very proud of you. If it had not been you guys we would not have been able to conduct two MUN programmes inviting five other colleges of the area in a short period of time. I hope these sessions have really helped you to develop your public speaking and diplomatic skills and enrich your knowledge about the world issues. 
The time I spent with you proved to be very fruitful to me as well. While helping you to improve your public speaking and chairing the committees I improved mine a lot. Working with the school administration and sometime negotiating with them I believe my diplomacy has gone up.  Moreover, this was the first time in my life that I got to learn so much about my own village which had seemed far away and distant in these recent years. This one month with you made me realise how little I knew about Gaindakot and how great it is. Thank you so much for helping me to experience the true Gaindakot and being wonderful friends. 
I would also like to thank Vijay FM for covering our progamme, VDRC for their technical support, Bhumiraj sir and Gopinath sir for attending our programme instead their busy schedule, providing us with wonderful ideas and motivating us (VSSS students are lucky to have people like you), LIMUN  for their technical support  and all the other colleges involved for their participation and encouragement. Thank you all- security dais, all the teachers involved, technicians dais and everyone who had helped directly and indirectly for making this programme a success. 
I would also like to express my sincere thanks and heartfelt gratitude to Deepak Wagle sir for believing in me and my idea about MUN and being able to see the importance of programmes like MUN for students of Gaindakot. He was always there helping and supporting me throughout my stay. For me, he was not only the principal of VSSS but also a friend and a mentor who was always there to help me and watch my back to make sure that everything was going the way it should go. Sir, you are a visionary man and you always have good intentions towards your school. I feel privileged to have got chance to work with you.
